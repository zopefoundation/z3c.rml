<para style="body">
	This tests the ability to make headings 'stick to' the paragraphs after them.  The heading style
	used is supposed to be kept with the next paragraph, even if this involves flopping onto the
	next page.  We have sized this text so that there is enough space for the heading below to
	fit into the top frame.  However, its style has a <i>keepWithNext</i> attribute set to 1, so it
	should flop down into the bottom half.  Cross your fingers....

<para style="head_keep">This should be on the bottom half</para>
<para style="body">

			To characterize a linguistic level L,
			this selectionally introduced contextual
			feature delimits the requirement that
			branching is not tolerated within the
			dominance scope of a complex
			symbol. Notice, incidentally, that the
			notion of level of grammaticalness
			does not affect the structure of the
			levels of acceptability from fairly high
			(e.g. (99a)) to virtual gibberish (e.g.
			(98d)). Suppose, for instance, that a
			subset of English sentences interesting
			on quite independent grounds appears
			to correlate rather closely with an
			important distinction in language use.
			Presumably, this analysis of a
			formative as a pair of sets of features is
			not quite equivalent to the system of
			base rules exclusive of the lexicon. We
			have already seen that the appearance
			of parasitic gaps in domains relatively
			inaccessible to ordinary extraction
			does not readily tolerate the strong
			generative capacity of the theory.
